C31RF Empirical Financial Modelling 2024 - 2025
Course Work: Panel Data Analysis
1.         Overview
      This   mid-term   assignment   is   based   on   30%   of total   marks   in   C31RF   on   an   individual   project.
      Submission format: each student submits the   assignment in   Canvas.
      Deadline for submission: Week 8 Monday 3rd   March 2025 4pm.
2.       BackgroundBanks play a crucial role in an   economy by   efficiently   allocating   scarce   resources   to   potential   borrowers   with   the   most   promising   prospects. However,   under conditions of   uncertainty,   where   relative   prices   can   no   longer   be   predicted   with   precision, the   efficient   allocation   of   funds   may fail to materialize.Research   has   demonstrated   that   reductions   in   loanable   funds   can   significantly   impact   bank-   dependent borrowers, such as small    businesses. These borrowers may face substantial   reductions in their fixed investment expenditures or, in extreme cases, bankruptcy (e.g.,   Ivashina and Scharfstein, 2010; Ferri et al., 2014). This    underscores      the      importance      of   understanding   of   the   factors   that   influence   banks’   lending   behavior,   a   topic   that   has   garnered renewed attention from researchers in the aftermath of   the 2008 financial   crisis.   The   crisis had   far-reaching repercussions for both developed and emerging economies throughout the   globe.In this coursework,   you are tasked with empirically examining the relationship between uncertainty and banks’ lending behavior. The    literature suggests that this relationship is influenced   by a combination of   bank-specific characteristics (e.g., size,   profitability, liquidity,   non-performing loans) and   macroeconomic    variables    (e.g., GDP growth rate, long-term interest   rates).   Therefore,   these   factors   should   be   incorporated   into   the   analysis   to   provide   a comprehensive   understanding   of   the   topic.
3.       DataYou can download the data file (Excel) from Canvas that contains a large panel of   commercial   banks   collected   from   the   Fitch   for UK banks.   Note   that   the   total   loans   and   total   net   loans   data   are   currently   in   logarithmic   format,   please   take   the   first   difference.   The   analysis   covers the period between   1999 – 2014.
4.       Reports Requirement
1)      Establish your hypothesis.You need to give prediction in a hypothesis based   on   literature   (You   should   find more   related   literature   to   support   your   hypothesis).   For   example,   H1:   There   is   a   positive   (or   negative)   relation between XXX and XXX.
2)      Briefly describe the research method you intend to   employ.
This   should   include: what   is the model   (formula)? what   is   the   dependent   variable?   And   what   are independent variables and control variables?
3)      Demonstrate empirical results.
You   are   required   to   employ   proper   model(s)   you   learn   from   this   course.   Results   should   be   demonstrated in well-organized table(s).
      Do not copy the original format of   tables   from   E-views   or   Stata!
      Look at papers on how   they   present   tables!
4)      Briefly discuss your results and give   the   conclusion(s).
5)      Briefly discuss the limits and potential problems of   this research.
6)      Optional Opportunity for Individual Initiative: In this part of   your Report, you have the   opportunity   (if   you wish to use   it   -   not   compulsory) to   discuss   other   potentia代 写C31RF Empirical Financial Modelling 2024 - 2025C/C++

7)      The length for the assignment should be ~1,500 words (excluding tables and references).
8)      Do not COPY contents directly   from   sources.
